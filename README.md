# Java MVC Contact Management System

A desktop-based CRUD application built with Java Swing, implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for clean, scalable code architecture.

## Engineering Highlights

* **MVC Architecture:** Strict separation of concerns between data logic (models), UI (views), and business logic (controllers).
* **User Authentication:** Includes a secure Login and Registration system with session management.
* **Data Validation:** Implemented advanced Regex-based email validation and mandatory field checks to ensure data integrity.
* **CSV Integration:** Built a custom CSVExporter to allow users to export their contact database for external use.
* **Full CRUD Capabilities:** Complete lifecycle management for contacts (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java 8+
* **UI Framework:** Java Swing / AWT
* **Pattern:** Model-View-Controller (MVC)
* **Data Handling:** CSV Export / Data Access Object (DAO) pattern
